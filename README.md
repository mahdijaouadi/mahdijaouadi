# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mahdi Jaouadi

🚀 Machine Learning Engineer

I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer and second-year IT engineering student at INSAT. My work bridges cutting-edge AI research and practical automation solutions—from self-healing CI/CD agents to intelligent stock trading bots. I thrive at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, and DevOps.

As a Machine Learning Engineer at AIDODEV, I developed a self-healing agent for CI/CD pipelines using Langchain and LangGraph, alongside a reliability verifier and prompt-based pipeline generators. At InfiniteBlocks, I built a stock trading RL agent that tripled S&P 500 returns (2018–2024) and fine-tuned deep learning models for finance. I also created a RAG chatbot using LLMs during my internship at AIDODEV.
